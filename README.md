During my internship at NIC (National Informatics Centre), I had the
opportunity to work on a live project to build a web application.
This internship provided me with a deep understanding of the
intricate workings of an esteemed organization like NIC and
allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world
scenarios.
